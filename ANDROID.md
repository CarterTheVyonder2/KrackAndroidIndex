# KRACK and Android

Android devices are under special risk. Here we dedicate a special page to Android devices and their current state of support. Due to the number of devices out in the wild, it is assumed that we will not be able to provide a complete list, but one can try.

Thank-you again to everyone who is working hard helping others with this issue.

## Index [I-M](/ANDROID_I-M.md) (3634 devices)
## Index [N-R](/ANDROID_N-R.md) (1476 devices)
